# Data-Visualization-and-Analysis
I have analyzed crime data by combining Python and Tableau to uncover meaningful insights. Using Python, I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability. Then, I made data visualization in Tableau with interactive dashboards that revealed patterns and trends, like crime rates by type, location, and time. This approach made complex data easy to understand and actionable.
